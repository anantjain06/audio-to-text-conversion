    "Project Manager (PM): Good morning, everyone. Let’s start with a quick round of updates on our progress. David, can you go first?"
    "Developer (David): Sure. This week I finished implementing the user login and registration features. I also fixed the cart syncing issue that was reported by QA."
    "PM: Great. Any blockers on your end?"
    "Developer (David): Not really. Although, I’m waiting for the final API spec for the payment gateway integration."
    "PM: Noted. I’ll follow up with the backend team on that. Anna, over to you."
    "Designer (Anna): I’ve completed the designs for the product listing and detail pages. I shared the Figma files yesterday. Next, I’ll work on the mobile layouts."
    "PM: Perfect. Please ensure the mobile version aligns with our responsive design system."
    "Designer (Anna): Will do."
    "PM: Sam, how’s QA progressing?"
    "QA Engineer (Sam): We completed smoke testing for the last sprint. We found 6 bugs, mostly minor UI inconsistencies. I’ve logged them in Jira. Also, testing for the registration flow is pending until tomorrow."
    "PM: Thanks. Please prioritize that and flag anything critical."
    "QA Engineer (Sam): Understood."
    "PM: Lastly, we’re planning for a client demo next Thursday. So, let’s make sure all major components are stable by Tuesday EOD. Any concerns?"
    "Developer (David): As long as I get the payment API by Monday, I should be good."
    "Designer (Anna): No concerns from my side."
    "QA Engineer (Sam): All good."
    "PM: Awesome. Thanks, team. Keep up the good work."
