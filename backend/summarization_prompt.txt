SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT = """
Given a customer care call transcript, provide a **detailed summary** of the entire conversation that includes:
- The **context** of the call (reason for the call).
- The **intent** and concerns raised by the customer.
- The **actions** or responses provided by the agent.
- Any **conflicts, dissatisfaction, or positive experiences**.
- The **final outcome or conclusion** of the conversation (e.g., issue resolved, appointment booked, etc.).
- If there is **no clear conclusion**, suggest a logical next step or conclusion based on the context.

Write the summary in a clear and professional tone so that any reader who hasnâ€™t heard the call can **understand the full context and status** of the conversation.

Keep the summary concise but complete. Avoid repeating the full dialogue. Focus on key points, resolution status, and tone (e.g., frustrated customer, helpful agent).
